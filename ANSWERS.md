## Questions one:
There are now three .gitignores. One for the project as a whole, one for the client, and one for the server. They can be found at:
1) .gitignore
2) client/gitignore
3) server/.gitignore

The main .gitignore deals with major project files such as the .idea folder, dependency libraries and config files.

The server .gitignore contains just a single line: `build` I don't know what this does at the moment.

I don't know what the server .gitignore file does either.
